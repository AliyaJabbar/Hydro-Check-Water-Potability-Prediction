# Hydro-Check-Water-Potability-Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether water is potable (safe for drinking) based on various physicochemical parameters. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze water quality data and classify it as potable or non-potable to help ensure safe drinking water.
